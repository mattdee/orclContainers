# Oracle Database Container Management Scripts

A collection of bash scripts to easily manage Oracle Database containers in either Docker or Podman environments.

## Overview

> **Note:** `orclDocker.sh` is maintained for historical reasons only and is no longer actively developed. `orclFreePodman.sh` is the preferred and actively maintained script for managing Oracle Database containers.

These scripts provide a convenient way to manage Oracle Database containers, allowing you to:
- Start/stop containers
- Access the container shell (bash or root)
- Connect to the database via SQLPlus
- Set up and serve ORDS (Oracle REST Data Services)
- Configure and test MongoDB API compatibility
- Install additional utilities
- Copy files in and out of the container
- And more

## Scripts

The repository contains two main scripts:

1. **orclFreePodman.sh** - For Podman environments (works on more platforms) - **Recommended**
2. **orclDocker.sh** - For Docker environments (macOS) - Maintained for historical purposes only

## Prerequisites

### For Docker (orclDocker.sh)
- Docker Desktop installed and running on macOS
- Internet connection for pulling images and installing utilities

### For Podman (orclFreePodman.sh)
- Podman installed (script can help install it if not present)
- On macOS: Homebrew for installing dependencies
- Internet connection for pulling images and installing utilities

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/orclDocker.git
   cd orclDocker
   ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x orclDocker.sh orclFreePodman.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Interactive Menu

Both scripts provide an interactive menu when run without arguments:

```bash
# Recommended: For Podman
./orclFreePodman.sh

# For Docker (legacy)
./orclDocker.sh
```

### Command Line Arguments

Both scripts support direct commands for various operations:

```bash
# Get help with available commands
./orclFreePodman.sh help
```

#### Command Examples for orclFreePodman.sh:

```bash
# Start the Oracle container
./orclFreePodman.sh start

# Stop the Oracle container
./orclFreePodman.sh stop

# Access bash shell in the container
./orclFreePodman.sh bash

# Access root shell in the container
./orclFreePodman.sh root

# Access SQLPlus as a user
./orclFreePodman.sh sqluser

# Access SQLPlus as SYSDBA
./orclFreePodman.sh sqlsys

# Start ORDS server
./orclFreePodman.sh ords

# Setup ORDS
./orclFreePodman.sh setupords

# Install utilities in the container
./orclFreePodman.sh utils

# Copy a file into the container
./orclFreePodman.sh copyin

# Copy a file out of the container
./orclFreePodman.sh copyout

# Clean unused volumes
./orclFreePodman.sh clean

# Check MongoDB API connection
./orclFreePodman.sh mongoapi
```

## Menu Options

### orclFreePodman.sh Menu

The menu is organized into logical sections:

**Container Management:**
- Start Oracle container
- Stop Oracle container
- Bash access
- Root access
- Remove Oracle container
- Install utilities
- Copy file into container
- Copy file out of container
- Clean unused volumes
- Exit script

**Database Access & Utilities:**
- SQL*Plus nolog connection
- SQL*Plus user connection
- SQL*Plus SYSDBA connection
- Setup ORDS
- Start ORDS service
- Check MongoDB API connection

### orclDocker.sh Options (Legacy)

1. Start Oracle docker image
2. Stop Oracle docker image
3. Bash access
4. SQLPlus nolog connect
5. SQLPlus SYSDBA
6. SQLPlus user
7. Do NOTHING (exit)

## Oracle Database Container Details

- **Image**: Oracle Database Free
- **Version**: Latest (23ai)
- **Default Credentials**:
  - SYS/SYSTEM password: `Oradoc_db1`
  - Created user: `matt` with password `matt`
- **Exposed Ports**:
  - 1521: Oracle Database listener
  - 5500: Enterprise Manager Express
  - 8080/8443: ORDS (Oracle REST Data Services)
  - 27017: MongoDB API compatibility

## Features

### Color-Coded Output and Improved Error Handling
The improved Podman script now features:
- Color-coded output for better readability
- Comprehensive error handling and status messages
- Clear success and failure notifications
- Improved user feedback during operations

### ORDS (Oracle REST Data Services)
The scripts support automatic setup and serving of ORDS, allowing RESTful web services access to the Oracle database.

### MongoDB API Compatibility
Oracle Database 23ai includes MongoDB API compatibility. The script supports configuration and testing of this feature.

### Container Management
- Start/stop/restart containers
- Clean unused volumes
- Install additional utilities (sudo, wget, htop, etc.)
- File transfer between host and container
- Root access for advanced operations

### Database Access
- SQLPlus with various connection methods (nolog, user, SYSDBA)
- Automatic user creation with DBA privileges

## Why Podman?

Podman offers several advantages over Docker:

1. **Daemonless architecture**: Podman doesn't require a background daemon to run
2. **Rootless containers**: Improved security with containers that don't require root privileges
3. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works well on Linux, macOS, and Windows
4. **OCI compliance**: Full compatibility with OCI (Open Container Initiative) standards
5. **Resource management**: Better management of CPU, memory, and storage resources

## Example Workflows

### Setting Up a New Oracle Database Container

```bash
./orclFreePodman.sh start
# The script will:
# 1. Check for and start Podman if needed
# 2. Create and start the Oracle container
# 3. Wait for the database to initialize
# 4. Install additional utilities
```

### Setting Up ORDS and MongoDB API

```bash
# Using command line arguments:
./orclFreePodman.sh setupords
./orclFreePodman.sh ords
./orclFreePodman.sh mongoapi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Container Not Starting
- Ensure Podman is installed and running
- Check for sufficient memory and disk space (container requires at least 8GB of RAM)
- Use the clean command to remove unused volumes: `./orclFreePodman.sh clean`

### Database Connection Issues
- Wait for the container to fully initialize (can take several minutes)
- Verify the container is running with `podman ps`
- Check for port conflicts with other services
- Review error messages with the improved color-coded output
